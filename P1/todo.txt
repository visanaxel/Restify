- All pages should have a navbar that includes relevant information such as links to home, feed, log out, my restaurant's page, a dropdown 
for the list of notifications, and another dropdown that shows the user's profile and includes a link to the edit profile page.

- The index page is the restaurant search page. To showcase the search result page, you should include some test restaurant cards, as well as the search 
bar for the demo.

- Cards must be clickable and point to the restaurant page, including various tabs such as general information and images, menu, blog posts, and comments.
You can design tab contents in a way that fits your website the most. It should contain the mentioned information about the restaurant. It is ok if different
cards link to the same restaurant page for the demo.

- The feed page, as well as the blog post page, should include a list of test blog post items with like buttons.

- You should also include various form pages: login, signup, edit profile, add/edit restaurant, add/edit menu, and add a blog post. Restaurant forms must be 
reachable through the restaurant page. That is, for the demo, we assume that the restaurant page is always accessed from the owner's view. Edit profile must 
be accessible through the navbar. However, since we assume that the demo is from the perspective of a logged-in user, you can leave the login and signup forms 
disconnected from the rest.
